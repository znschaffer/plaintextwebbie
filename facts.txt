My name is Zane Schaffer

I am 27 years old.

I am an engineering student at North Seattle College.

I was born in Seattle, grew up in Bellevue, and lived around the world for the
past decade.

I had a successful career as a music producer, playing shows in different
countries and living off revenue.

My interests are in Digital Signal Processing, synthesizer design, analog
solutions to simple problems, and low level languages.
