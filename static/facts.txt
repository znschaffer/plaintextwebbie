My name is Zane Schaffer 
I am 27 years old 👨.

I am an engineering student at North Seattle College.

I was born in Seattle ☂, grew up in Bellevue 💰, and lived around the world for the
past decade.

I had a successful career as a music producer, playing shows in different
countries and living off revenue.

My interests are in Digital Signal Processing, synthesizer design, analog
solutions to simple problems, and low level languages.

This site is written in UTF-8 text files, with the home page directory spit out
by my modified version of tree(1). 

It is all embeded into a single Go binary that acts as this webserver.
